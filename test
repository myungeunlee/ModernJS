Thank you for your answer.

However, I couldn't take the test because I couldn't confirm my name while checking my ID.
I have prepared a driver's license and a credit card with English name because it is not written in English on the driver's license.

but, the supervisor in charge gave me a guide to reschedule the test.
I sent an e-mail because I thought it was possible to change the schedule for free.
I couldn't take the test due to the above situation, so I would like to ask you to change the schedule without any cost.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
